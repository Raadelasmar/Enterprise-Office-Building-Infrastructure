I'm pleased to announce the completion of my latest project, "Enterprise Office Building Infrastructure" 🏢.

This project involved designing and implementing a scalable and secure network across a multi-department office building. Each of the eight departments—Finance, HR, Sales, IT, Admin, Reception, Store, and Logistics—was assigned a dedicated VLAN for optimal network segmentation and security 🛡️.

I implemented dynamic addressing using DHCP and ensured efficient inter-departmental routing through OSPF. Additionally, security and remote management were strengthened through SSH and specialized port security configurations. Both wired and wireless network configurations were carefully implemented to ensure full end-to-end communication between devices 📶.

The entire network was designed, configured, and tested in Cisco Packet Tracer, following real-world enterprise design principles.
